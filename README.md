FAME Protocol is a fair launch protocol built on Solana, designed to offer a transparent and equitable platform that enables all users to participate in and benefit from the growth and appreciation of meme coins. All projects deployed through this protocol are guaranteed against rug pulls, providing users with a fast and cost-effective environment for the creation, trade, and circulation of meme coins.
